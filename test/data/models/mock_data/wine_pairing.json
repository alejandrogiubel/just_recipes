  "pairingText": "Chardonnay, Gruener Veltliner, and Sauvignon Blanc are great choices for Pasta. Sauvignon Blanc and Gruner Veltliner both have herby notes that complement salads with enough acid to match tart vinaigrettes, while a Chardonnay can be a good pick for creamy salad dressings. The Buddha Kat Winery Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 25 dollars per bottle.",
